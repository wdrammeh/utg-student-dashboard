# UTG-Student Dashboard
`v1.6.3`

A flexible and elegant student management system for the University of The Gambia.
_Dashboard is built by the students for the students._

Dashboard uses the Portal system of UTG as a center of verification for users.
The same portal is therefore used as the main source of users-data for,
 but not limited to, verification, analysis, and presentation.
 
As of version 1.6.2, the "Try Dashboard" feature is implemented.
This allows non-UTG students to temporarily use Dashboard,
or students who wish to explore Dashboard before signing in.

To be familiar with the general execution flow of the program, read the logic.txt file.

This project does not use any frameworks. However, several third-party libraries were deployed.
Please see the overview.txt file for more information.
